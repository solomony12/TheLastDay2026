# The Last Day

**Today marks the last day of the zombie apocalypse.** Humanity has finally invented the cure. Two scientists demonstrate it in front of you—and it works!

You are **the delivery boy**, tasked with injecting the cure into zombies. But there’s a catch: there aren’t enough doses for every infected person. The remaining zombies will be gunned down.

You must make difficult decisions: **who is more worthy to live?** A boy or a mother? A soldier or a nun?

Be careful! Act too slowly or get too close, and you could be bitten—then you might need a shot yourself.
